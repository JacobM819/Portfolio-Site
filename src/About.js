                    Hello! Iâ€™m Jacob Meyer, and I have a passion for creating software that solves real problems.
                    My interest in creating apps started in high school, where I learned to code to make online school easier
                    and more enjoyable for students. Through the years, I have gained experience in designing applications
                    from simple landing pages, all the way to full scale applications with thousands of users.
                    I am always eager to learn new things and find ways to improve my code to provide seamless user
                    experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am in my third year at Penn State University, where I am studying computer science.
                    I am searching for a Software Engineering Internship for the Summer of 2025, if you
                    are interested in hiring, feel free to contact me via email or LinkedIn.
                    After college, I would like to have a career in back-end software-engineering, where I can create
                    efficient, scalable code for others to enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I am not working on passion projects, I like to stay active by playing tennis or going to
                    the gym. I also like to play video games and watch movies or TV shows.
                </p>
